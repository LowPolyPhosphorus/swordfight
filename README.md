# swordfight
3 ESP32s, 2 swords + 1 hub. you swing, you clash, the hub keeps score. 

## how it detects hits
each sword has an MPU6050 strapped in. when the blades clash, the accelerometer picks up a sharp spike (sudden stop = spike). no contact sensors hopefully it will just watch for the spike pattern. debounce it so one clash doesn't count as five. 

## how scoring works
a clash happens on both swords simultaneously (woah), so instead of "who hit first" (doesnt make sense for a clash) we would compare who swung harder (?) bigger impact magnitude wins that exchange. close calls (withinn ~10%?) = no winner, just a "clang", but nobody's combo breaks.

winning streaks build a combo multiplier. lose a clash (or tie) and it resets, so momentum matters, you have to keep swinging hard to protect a streak.

health bar drains based on clash losses, scaled by the other guy's combo. first to zero (or whoever's ahead when time's up) wins.

## the lights
each sword should get one like on the blade or something

* idle color = which player 
* pulses brighter as your combo builds 
* flashes on impact
* dims as you take damage, so the sword itself doubles as a health readout


hub might get a strip too for a bigger shared health/score display, visible from far away.

the mesh
swords talk to the hub over ESP-NOW so theres no wifi router needed, low latency, works fine in a packed venue with either no wifi or its really bad :pf:

## stretch goals

* laptop dashboard over websocket, live health/combo feed, like a sword visualizer on screen from like general orientation
* sound effects of the speaker for clashes
* integrate a web cam or something for position tracking on screen (maybe idk if there will be webcams there)
